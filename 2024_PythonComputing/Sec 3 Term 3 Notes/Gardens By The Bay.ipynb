    "Each type of flower is represented by the following attributes: height, bloom, and wilt. \n",
    "height represents how high each type of flower grows, \n",
    "bloom represents the morning that each type of flower springs from the ground, and \n",
    "wilt represents the evening that each type of flower shrivels up and dies. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must plant all of the flowers of the same type in a single row for appearance, and you also want to have the tallest flowers as far forward as possible. However, if a flower type is taller than another type, and both types can be out of the ground at the same time, the shorter flower must be planted in front of the taller flower to prevent blocking. A flower blooms in the morning, and wilts in the evening, so even if one flower is blooming on the same day another flower is wilting, one can block the other.\n",

The front of the garden is represented by the first element in your return value, and is where you view the garden from.

    "The difference here is that the third type of flower wilts one day earlier than the blooming of the fourth flower. Therefore, we can put the flowers of height 3 first, then the flowers of height 4, then height 5, and finally the flowers of height 1 and 2. Note that we could have also ordered them with height 1 first, but this does not result in the maximum possible height being first in the garden.\n"
